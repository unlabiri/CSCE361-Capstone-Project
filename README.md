Voting System for the City of Pacopolis
Authors: Ada Aljabiri Jason DiBraccio Riley Camelin Sean Casey Zephyr Rose

This project is an electronic voting system developed for the city of Pacopolis for current and future elections. The system is designed to support election types, including the election deciding the mayor between Pat Mann and Dawn Keykong, as well as future local issues. The system is accessible to voters through their personal computers or via shared computers at polling locations.
Voters are authenticated on logging in - only registered voters can cast a ballot.
After logging in, voters are shown the ballot, listing all candidates and issues up for a vote.
Voters can review their selections before submitting. They have the option to make changes to their choices before submitting their ballot.
Once the voter confirms their choices, the system securely records the votes. Duplicate voting within the same election is prohibited.
At the end of the election, the system automatically tallies votes to determine the winner of each election and the outcome of each issue.
While other users can check if a person voted, the system is does not show who an individual voted for.
Frontend: React (used to build the user interface)
Backend: SQL and C# for database management, backend operations
